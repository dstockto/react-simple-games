This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is a toy for learning React along with some of the new hooks
available for management of state, lifecycle, etc. It will start with some
simple games - Tic-Tac-Toe, Sudoku and Nonograms as well as a math tutor program.

It is using CSS Grid, React-Router and a few other pieces that come up as the
learning process continues. Primarily it is in use for a work Code Camp, so 
if you stumble on this repo and you're not familiar with Code Camp where I work
or you don't work with me, you're welcome to contribute, but the primary 
reason for the repo to exist is to help the employees attending Code Camp.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`
